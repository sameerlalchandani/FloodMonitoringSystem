Floods pose a major threat to infrastructure and human life. Dams require continuous monitoring to detect overflow conditions early. A system is needed to:

1. Measure water levels continuously.

2. Trigger alerts when safe limits are crossed.

3. Communicate to authorities in real time using cloud infrastructure.
