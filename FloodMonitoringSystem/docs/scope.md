# **Scope of the Solution**



1. Real-time Monitoring:

Continuous monitoring of dam water flow levels using IoT-based sensors to detect and track fluctuations accurately.



2\. Cloud-Based Alerting System:

Automatic generation and transmission of real-time alerts to authorities via cloud services (e.g., MQTT, Blynk, or Firebase) when water levels cross critical thresholds.



3\. Simulation Environment:

Development and validation of the system through simulation platforms such as Wokwi, ensuring functionality before physical deployment.



4\. Cost-Effective Hardware:

Utilization of low-cost, easily available components such as NodeMCU/ESP32 and compatible water level sensors to maintain affordability and scalability.



5\. Future Expansion Possibilities:

The system can be enhanced to include features like remote-controlled floodgates, integration with weather forecast APIs, or mobile notifications for public awareness.
